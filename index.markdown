# What is BOUT++?

* Framework for writing fluid and plasma simulations in curvilinear geometry
* Finite-difference code, variety of numerical methods and time-integration solvers
* Intended to be quite modular, enabling fast testing of numerical methods
* Can evolve any number of equations, with equations appearing in a readable form
* Primarily designed and tested with reduced plasma fluid models in mind
* Jointly developed by LLNL, University of York (UK) and other U.S. and international partners
